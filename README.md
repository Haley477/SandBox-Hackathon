# SandBox-Hackathon

This project is a rough draft of an automated email reminder project. 
The focus and point of this project is so that instead of emails getting lost in your email that are important, you can set up personal reminders that will remind you of that current email. We were trying to take an approach that made it so that you didn't need access and didn't need to embed anything into the person's email allowing more secure access.
